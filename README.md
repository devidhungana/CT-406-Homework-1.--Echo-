# CT-406 Homework 1. 
Here are all the Homework-1 exercises. 
There are four exercises "Echo", "Enviroments", "MiniWeb", and "File Server".

# Echo
This is a simple web application that writes out the segment of the url that follows the server name. 
For this simple application, we don't need startup class/file, we can write a code in program.cs. When we 
lunch the application it will open the default browser and shows the output.

# Enviroment
This is a simple web appliaction that will print the output on the browser. More likely, hello world program. In this application, we only use startup.cs, there was no need for program.cs. It should print "Enviroment=Development" when lanunch.

# MiniWeb
This program is little longer and complicated. We need control classes, Json file, and interface. 
Here we tried to build a very thin but functional mini website. In this application, the website will hold a list of the world's countries and return a filtered list based on the hints provided by the query string.

# File Server
In this web application we wrote a program that call to UseSaticFiles twice. This enables the program to locate the file under assets folder under the root directory of the site. Basically, we provide the file pathname and it will display the content of the file, Ex- images. on the browser.
